1.1   WHY STUDY ALGORITHMS?
Good base in algorithms is required to build scalable performant software

The course content:
The power of algorithms
Big O notation - linear, logarithmic, constant and polynomial time
Basic sorting algorithms - insertion, bubble and selection sort
Advanced sorting algorithms - merge and quick sort

2.2 BIG O NOTATION

Constant time - O(1) will always execute in the same amount of time regardless of the input size.
Linear time - O(n) the run time will grow proportionally to the growth of the input size.
Quadratic time - O(n2) the run time is directly proportional to the square of the input size. These typically involve nested iterations over the input set. Deeper nested iterations will result in increasingly less desireable run times: Cubic time - O(n3), Quartic time - O(n4)
Logarithmic time - O(log n) a highly efficient algorithm, used by the binary search technique for example


2.6 ADVICE FOR AVOIDING (n^k) COMPLEXITY
Wherever possible, try to avoid nested iterations (this will lead to polynomial time or worse)
Performance testing with a benchtimer is imperative
Look to replace nested operations with techniques outlined in the next section
Document your algorithm thoroughly to explain why your approach works.

2.7 LOGARITHMIC COMPLEXITY
The logarithm of a number is the exponenet to which another fixed number (the base) must be raised to produce that number.

logA(B) = C as A^C = B (the base is B)
log3(9) = 2 as 3^2 = 9
log10(1000) = 3 as 10^3 = 1000

When considering Big O, we disregard the base and simply say O(log n)
